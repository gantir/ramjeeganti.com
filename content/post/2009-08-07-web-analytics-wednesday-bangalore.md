I am off radar of any kind of social events for some time. I am now back with helping the organization of Web Analytics Wednesday Bangalore, August 2009. The event is on 12th August at Indiranagar Club.

Data Speak is the theme of the blog, and you have not seen much happen over here in the one month of existence of this blog. I will take this event to kick start my blogging efforts over here. So keep coming in to see what to make out of all the data you have.

For now check the details of the event at the [WAW (Web Analytics Wednesday) Bangalore](http://wawbangalore.pbworks.com/) site. You might also want to check out [Web analytics Demystified](http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/) for the origins of [WAW](http://www.webanalyticsdemystified.com/wednesday/index.asp)

If you have anything to do with Web Analytics and you are in Bangalore, this is the event for you. Drop by and we will have some great discussions.
