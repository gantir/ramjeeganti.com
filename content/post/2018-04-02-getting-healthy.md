Sometime ago, which now seems a long time ago, I stumbled upon a talk titled [Sugar the bitter Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) by [Dr. Robert Lustig](http://www.robertlustig.com/).

It was a mind opener, many unanswered questions for got resolved at different stages of his talk. Since then it has been my mission to explore different aspects of health, primarily experimenting with food. In a series of posts, I will be writing about my learnings, my dabbling with cooking and so on.

[Kilter blog](https://blog.kilter.in/) has been one of the key resources which helped me in the early days. I gave an [interview](https://blog.kilter.in/my-keto-an-interview-for-kilter-a0a37df9e8ce) on their site, about my weight loss story.

Let's start the series by watching the lecture that transformed my attitude to food. It's a long video, get your focus ready.
