Sometime ago, which now seems a long time ago, I stumbled upon a talk titled [Sugar the bitter Truth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM) by [Dr. Robert Lustig](http://www.robertlustig.com/).

It was a mind opener, many questions that I had in my mind for a long time had answers at different stages of his talk. Since then it has been my mission to explore different aspects of health primarily experimenting with food. In a series of posts, I will be writing about my learnings, my dabbling with cooking and so on.

[Kilter blog](https://blog.kilter.in/) has been one of the key resources which helped me in the early days. I wrote a small [interview](https://blog.kilter.in/my-keto-an-interview-for-kilter-a0a37df9e8ce) on their site, about my weight loss story.

Let's start the series by watching the lecture that transformed my attitude to food.
