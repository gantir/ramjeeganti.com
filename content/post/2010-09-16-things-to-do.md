It has been a long long time to be precise just more than an year since any kind of activity on this blog. I take the blame. Partly due to laziness , partly due to writers block, and a lot due to lack of focus.

Now I am on the way to resurrect some of the things. The following is the list of items I want to post about/work on and this blog will be the place for realizing them. In no particular order let me dive in to what all I want to do

* Complete doing the [NerdDinner](http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Intro.htm) ASP.NET tutorial.

* Port the NerdDinner application to [web2py](www.web2py.com)

* Expand py2dinner to work on Google App Engine.

* Expand py2dinner to learn hosting SAAS applications on Google App Engine.

* Write a series of posts ([here](http://nerddinnerbook.s3.amazonaws.com/Intro.htmv))

* Write a series of posts on cookies.

* Write on how cookies are used to tracking user behavior.

* Write on how third party cookies help tracking user behavior across sites.

* Write on using flash for user tracking.

* Write on using html5 and associated technologies (websql) etc for user tracking.

* Develop an application for managing a list of users, sending them mails etc.(primarily to achieve requirements at iitkgpblr chapter)

* Develop a small application for user behavior tracking.

The above list will keep expanding. The goal I set for myself for the rest of the year is to churn out a minimum of one post per week. I will keep updating the list as and when I get some ideas. Enough time has been spent lazing around, not letâ€™s get to some action.

The original post was salvaged from [Way Back Machine](http://web.archive.org/web/20111117032338/http://ramjeeganti.com/).
