A long long time since my [last post]({{< ref "post/2014-01-12-cutting-down-on-email-overload.md" >}}). Things have changed significantly since then.

Moved out of Bangalore and [JUST EAT](http://justeat.in). A move more significant than I realised, when I made it earlier this year. Though got adjusted to Mumbai and it's unique outlook at life, there are few things in the corner of the heart that root for Bangalore. I would not have thought this remotely possible before the move to Mumbai.

Starting from scratch in a new city makes you take note of a lot of things that you take for granted in your life. In a way this move woke me up from a comfort zone that 10 years in Bangalore has put me in. I also came to realise how imporatnt settling down at one place is from getting things done.

I might get into many more details into what a move like this entails and what one needs to keep in mind in a later post, for now will touch upon two of my distinct observations:

* Looks as if everyone in the city is always in a hurry to get somewhere. If one is not cognizant enough, they will get sucked into this fast paced life. Have to watch how long I can resist this.
* Those of you who know me know, how much I was fond of Mumbai. This time around I don't get the same feeling of belongingness to this city, which I had way back in 2003. Who changed? Is it me or the city or both?

It's over 18 months since my last post here. I will recount some intersting slices:

* March 2014, we put Aashrita in [Discover Montessori](http://www.discover-montessori.org/). Probably the best place for a kid to spend his/her early life.
* May 2014, Seby invited all the [Nabler](http://nabler.com) alumni for it's 10th anniversary. Truly appreciate his gesture. One of the best individuals I have worked with.
* October 2014, Launched a complete new look Android App. and an Android delivery app. Probably best showcase to all the effort put by team at JUST EAT in my stay there.
* Jan 2014, I moved on from JUST EAT to [BigDecisions](http://bigdecisions.com) and from Bangalore to Mumbai.
* Sept 2014, revamped this site and built it in [hugo](https://gohugo.io) away from [octopress](http://octopress.org/).

There are many more incidents that happened in this period which shaped my thoughts. Will jot them down over the next few months.
