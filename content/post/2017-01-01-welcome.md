Welcome 2017. Every new year starts with a lot of promise and ends with promise for the next year. The action in between is many times forgotten. It's been a long time since I wrote anything and can feel the rust in the finger tips.

One thing I promise to myself is, I will write more often. There are a lot more that 2017 awaits but let's unveil it as it happens. For now "Welcome"!!
