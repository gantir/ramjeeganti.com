I have been blogging at [So-did-i](http://sodidi.ramjeeganti.com/) and a few other places for about 4 years. It was high time that I got my own domain and host the blog. This blog â€œ[Data Speak](http://www.ramjeeganti.com/)" as the name suggests is mostly about data and how it affects our ability to make decisions. Initially I will concentrate on [Web Analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_analytics).

For the uninitiated, Web Analytics deals with the analysis of data measured on a web site for the purpose of understanding and optimizing the sites usage. At this juncture Web Analytics is also closely associated with Web Measurement, though I am sure in future once the technlogy behind measurement is matured, these both will be two distinct but dependent fields.

I leave you here, with some food for thought. Complete the series 1,1,2,3,5,8,?.
