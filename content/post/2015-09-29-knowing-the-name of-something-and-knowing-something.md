I have always been inspired by [Richard Feynman](http://www.feynman.com/). I wish everyone one in this country learns from him. One great nugget of wisdom from this great man. One of my favorite nugget from the ocean of knowledge that he left behind is, "The Difference Between Knowing the Name of Something and Knowing Something".

> See that bird? It’s a brown-throated thrush, but in Germany it’s called a halzenfugel, and in Chinese they call it a chung ling and even if you know all those names for it, you still know nothing about the bird. You only know something about people; what they call the bird. Now that thrush sings, and teaches its young to fly, and flies so many miles away during the summer across the country, and nobody knows how it finds its way.

Once you get the true meaning of the above, it is one of the Nirvana moments. Have a look at the video below and think about it.
