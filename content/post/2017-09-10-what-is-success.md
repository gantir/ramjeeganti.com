Over the last few months since my move back to Bangalore, one thing troubling me is what does success mean to me?

* Is it earning more money? How much is more?
* Is it earning fame? What is fame?
* Is it peer acceptance/recognition? Who are these peers and why should one strive for their recognition?
* Is it an accomplishment? What kind of acomplishment? Personal or Public?
* Is it achieving something which I felt difficult or the society finds/terms difficult?
* The list goes on ...

What does even achieving success mean? If I achieved success in societal norms but am personally not happy is that ok?
What does happiness mean? Will I be more happy when I get most of the above stuff than not?
